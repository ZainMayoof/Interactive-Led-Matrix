# Interactive-Led-Matrix
An interactive 6x6 LED grid that responds to capacitive touch input. Built using an Arduino MEGA, MPR121 capacitive touch sensors, and WS2812 addressable LEDs, this project combines light and touch interaction.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… 6x6 grid of individually addressable LEDs
âœ… Capacitive touch interaction using MPR121 sensors
âœ… Expandable to include sound effects for interactive feedback
